Several cities like Ludhiana and Amritsar have tackled the issue of staff deficit by outsourcing collection centres.

These provisions should also be combined with dissemination of defaulters’ list in public domain, for instance, at the ULB’s offices, collection centres, website, etc. and through the communication to the defaulter via demand notices.For instance, as per an amendment to the Chennai City Municipal Corporation Act, 1919, assessees who pay advance property tax, i.e. before October 15 of each year, will be given a 5% incentive (upto a maximum of Rs. 5,000/-) and payments made after October 15 of each year will attract a penalty of 2% p.a.Early bird discounts and late payment penalties have also shown positive results in Pune, Hyderabad and Delhi’s Municipal Corporations by boosting early payments by taxpayers which consequently has helped improve availability of cash flows throughout the year.International examples also showcase that a strong emphasis on improving administrative processes leads to an uptake in collections. For example, in Quezon City, Philippines, the Local Government Code provides for various enforcement provisions including seizure and auctioning of delinquent properties. To boost revenue collections, the Local Government has adopted a system of implementing enforcement provisions coupled with an incentives mechanism for taxpayers- discounts for early payment and penalties for late payment which led to more timely payments.",

For example, The Maharashtra State Act introduced transition provisions when the State moved to the Capital Value system to reduce the anticipated increase in tax demand. These transition provisions included the ceiling of the tax value for the first five years of implementation of the Capital Value method. ‘For the period of 5 years from the date on which property tax is first levied on capital value, the tax shall not exceed (i) in case of residential building, 2 times, (ii) in case of non-residential building, 3 times the amount of the property tax leviable in respect thereof in the year immediately preceding such date.
